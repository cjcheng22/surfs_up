## Overview of the analysis: 
### W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results:

![December Temps](./Resources/december_temps.png)
### -Comparing between the 2 key temperature statics of June vs December, overall December temperature is about 3 degreess lower than June.
### -With the means of 74 degrees in June and 71 degrees in December, the mean temperatures in June and December are considered summer-like weather yeararound.
### -Max temperature in June and December are 85 degrees and 83 degrees, respectively.  Max temperature statistics also validates that the island has summer-like weather yeararound.  

## Summary:
### W.Avy should feel confident that the temperature data/statistics validates that the surf and ice cream will both sell well in the island of Oahu, because it has summer-like weather year-around.
### However:
#### 1. We should present W. Avy with another analysis, monthly precipitation, to compare whether it will rain often in those months.  When it rains less customer will want to visit for surfing.
#### 2. During those high-precipitation months, Surf n' Shake shop should concentrate their business to ice cream than surfing sales/rentals.
